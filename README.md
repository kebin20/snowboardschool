First project, making my own full-fledged snowboard website. 

28.05.2022
At this moment, my current webpages are using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bootstrap grids, Flexbox with a tinge of JavaScript. In addition, I have made my websites responsive to various screen sizes.

I am currently learning JavaScript properly, so I am hoping to add in more functionality to my webpage.

My webpage consists of a:
- Homepage
- Login page
- Registration Page
- Rentals (WIP)
- Pricing (WIP)
